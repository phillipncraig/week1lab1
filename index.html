    <h1>Phill Craig - Web Developer (in progress...)</h1>
        </br>
    <section>
        <p>I'm a 28 year old New Zealander, recently moved to Vancouver, and working towards becoming a web developer. I'm a huge fan of the outdoors, especially skiing and hiking - so BC was a clear winner for where I wanted to live in Canada!</p>
        <p>Since arriving here, I've started to build my own startup business. I'm particuarly passionate about the sciences thanks to my background as a synthetic chemist, and as a result I'm creating an equity crowdfunding marketplace that will bring investors and research scientists together called <a href="http://startthereaction.com">Start the Reaction</a>, and I'm really excited to launch later this year and help support local Canadian researchers get funding for their research.</p>
        <p>My github profile can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/phillipncraig">here</a>.</p>
